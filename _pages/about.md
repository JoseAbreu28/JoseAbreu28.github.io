Hello, I’m José Abreu, and I hold a degree in Computer and Network Security (Cybersecurity) from Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão - Instituto Politécnico do Porto. I have a strong passion for Pentesting and Red Team operations, which drives my curiosity and constant learning in the cybersecurity field.

Through this blog, I aim to share my personal experiences with various projects that I've had the chance to explore and implement. While many of the projects discussed here were not created by me, I’ll be focusing on my experiences — including the study process, the implementation steps, and what fascinated me the most about each project. My goal is to provide insights, tips, and reflections that might be helpful to others in the cybersecurity community.
