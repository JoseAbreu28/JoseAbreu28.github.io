title: CVE-2025-69929 - Privilege Escalation via Password Hash Disclosure in n3uron
categories: [Pentesting,RedTeam, n3uron, hashcat ]
---

## Introduction  
During security testing of the n3uron application, a critical vulnerability was identified that allows a low-privileged authenticated user to access sensitive information belonging to all registered users of the platform, including password hashes.

The issue is caused by a combination of insecure design decisions:

- Excessive data exposure through WebSocket communications

- Lack of proper authorization checks on sensitive configuration endpoints

- Use of client-side password hashing with a predictable and weak cryptographic scheme

When combined, these issues significantly reduce the effort required for an attacker to perform offline password cracking, potentially leading to privilege escalation and lateral movement.

## Test Environment Setup
For the purpose of this assessment, I hosted the n3uron application locally on my machine and created a new user account with standard, non-administrative privileges in order to simulate a realistic low-privileged attacker scenario. The application was deployed on localhost, and the test account, named ```joe``` , was assigned a standard user role with no elevated permissions.

## Exploitation

After deploying the n3uron application locally, I authenticated to the platform using a standard, non-administrative user account named joe. This account was intentionally configured with low privileges to simulate a realistic attacker scenario.

While navigating through the application, I accessed the configuration interface and confirmed that, despite using a non-administrative account, it was possible to access the ```Config - Roles - Users/Groups``` endpoint at ``http://localhost:8003/ui?nav=config&config=users`` and enumerate all registered users on the platform.

While interacting with this functionality, I monitored the application traffic and identified that the frontend communicates with the backend using WebSockets. Upon loading the user management interface, the WebSocket response returned detailed information for all registered users. Notably, this response included password hashes for every account, including users with higher privileges.

To further assess the impact, I analyzed the client-side JavaScript code located at ``/app/app.js`` and identified the function responsible for hashing user passwords. The application performs password hashing entirely on the client side using the MD5 algorithm applied to a predictable string format. The hashing logic applies the MD5 algorithm to a predictable string format, specifically `"n3@" + password + "@"`
, and because this logic is exposed to the client, both the cryptographic function and its input are fully disclosed, significantly reducing the effort required to perform offline password cracking once the hashes are obtained.

As a result, a low-privileged authenticated user can collect password hashes belonging to more privileged accounts and attempt to crack them offline. Given that the hashing algorithm and input format are fully disclosed and rely on a weak MD5-based scheme, successful cracking may lead to privilege escalation within the application or the reuse of compromised credentials for lateral movement in other systems.

To further reduce the effort required to crack the obtained hashes, I developed a custom Hashcat rule based on the n3uron client-side hashing implementation. This rule reproduces the exact string manipulation performed before hashing, significantly improving cracking efficiency when combined with standard wordlists.

```^@^3^n$@```

If the hashes are successfully cracked offline, an attacker may escalate privileges within the application or reuse the compromised credentials to access other services on the network.

## Conclusion 
This vulnerability clearly originates from a combination of multiple development flaws within the application rather than a single isolated issue. In the context in which it was discovered—in the wild during an internal client penetration test—these weaknesses could be effectively chained together to achieve real-world impact. By exploiting the exposed WebSocket data and insecure client-side hashing logic, it was possible to crack credentials offline and perform lateral movement by compromising additional user accounts.

This case highlights how insufficient access control, excessive trust in the client, and poor cryptographic practices can collectively lead to a critical security failure. Adopting strict server-side authorization, minimizing data exposure, and implementing modern, server-side password hashing mechanisms are essential to prevent vulnerabilities of this nature.
