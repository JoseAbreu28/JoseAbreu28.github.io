title: CVE-2025-69929 - Privilege Escalation via Password Hash Disclosure in n3uron
categories: [Pentesting,RedTeam, n3uron, hashcat ]
---

## Introduction  
During security testing of the n3uron application, a critical vulnerability was identified that allows a low-privileged authenticated user to access sensitive information belonging to all registered users of the platform, including password hashes.

The issue is caused by a combination of insecure design decisions:

- Excessive data exposure through WebSocket communications

- Lack of proper authorization checks on sensitive configuration endpoints

- Use of client-side password hashing with a predictable and weak cryptographic scheme

When combined, these issues significantly reduce the effort required for an attacker to perform offline password cracking, potentially leading to privilege escalation and lateral movement.
